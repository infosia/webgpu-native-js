# Tracking: engine boundary (`trait JsEngine`)

Topic owner: the core/adapter boundary — `CLAUDE.md` invariant 1, plan §2.4.

## Q1 — Does JSC's public C API expose ArrayBuffer detach?

**Status: ANSWERED (2026-07-09). No. Design absorbed it as a capability; the
boundary survives.**

This was the highest-priority Phase 0 spike (plan §4, Phase 0.1) because
`getMappedRange()` must return an `ArrayBuffer` that `unmap()` **detaches**, and
a failure here was the most likely way the "one core, two engines" bet breaks.

### Environment

macOS 26.5.1 (build 25F80), Xcode SDK 26.5, system
`JavaScriptCore.framework` (bundle version 21624). Probes were Objective-C
programs linking the system framework and driving the public C API.

### Evidence

**E1 — the public C API has no detach.** The exported surface of
`JSTypedArray.h` is exactly:

```
JSObjectMakeTypedArray                    JSObjectGetTypedArrayBytesPtr
JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithBytesNoCopy     JSObjectGetTypedArrayLength
JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithArrayBuffer     JSObjectGetTypedArrayByteLength
JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithArrayBufferAndOffset
                                          JSObjectGetTypedArrayByteOffset
JSObjectMakeArrayBufferWithBytesNoCopy    JSObjectGetTypedArrayBuffer
                                          JSObjectGetArrayBufferBytesPtr
                                          JSObjectGetArrayBufferByteLength
```

A case-insensitive search for `detach` or `transfer` across **all** public
JavaScriptCore headers (`JSBase.h`, `JSObjectRef.h`, `JSValueRef.h`,
`JSTypedArray.h`, `JSStringRef.h`, `JSContextRef.h`, and the Obj-C headers)
returns **no match**. There is no C-level detach, and no C-level way to observe
detachment.

**E2 — the JS-level `ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer()` exists and works on
*normal* buffers.** `typeof ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer === "function"`, and
for a script-allocated `new ArrayBuffer(8)`, `b.transfer()` yields
`b.detached === true`. The `detached` getter is present (`'detached' in ab`).
This is reachable from the C API via `JSObjectGetProperty` +
`JSObjectCallAsFunction`.

**E3 — on an *external* (`…WithBytesNoCopy`) buffer, `transfer()` is not
dependable.** Across probes:

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| `ab.transfer()` on a fresh external buffer | once returned a new 8-byte buffer with **`ab.detached === false`** and the original still readable; once threw `TypeError: Buffer is already detached` on a *freshly created* buffer |
| `ab.transfer(8)` (explicit length) on a fresh external buffer | `detached === true` |
| `ab.transferToFixedLength()` | `TypeError` |
| `structuredClone` / `Worker` (transfer-list routes) | `ReferenceError` — absent from a bare `JSContext` |

**E4 — the `bytesDeallocator` never fired** in any probe, including after a
successful `transfer(8)`. So even where detach appears to succeed, there is no
public signal that JSC has released the external memory.

### Interpretation

E1 alone rules out the obvious design. E3's inconsistency — a no-arg
`transfer()` that silently leaves the source attached in one trial and reports
an already-detached buffer in another — means the semantics of `transfer()` over
externally-backed storage are, at minimum, unspecified for our purposes. E4
means we could not safely reclaim the memory even if detach were reliable.

The consequence is not a spec deviation, it is **memory unsafety**: if
`getMappedRange()` hands script a `…WithBytesNoCopy` view over GPU-mapped memory
and `unmap()` cannot detach it, a script that retains the `ArrayBuffer` holds a
dangling pointer. That is a CRITICAL-class defect, not a conformance footnote.

### Decision

**`getMappedRange()` never hands JSC a NoCopy view over GPU memory.**

`trait JsEngine` gains a capability, declared by each adapter:

```rust
enum MappedRangeStrategy {
    /// Wrap the GPU mapping directly; `unmap()` detaches the external buffer.
    ZeroCopyDetach,
    /// Hand script a normal engine-owned ArrayBuffer.
    /// MAP_READ:  copy GPU -> JS at getMappedRange().
    /// MAP_WRITE: copy JS -> GPU at unmap(), then detach.
    CopyInCopyOut,
}
```

- **QuickJS → `ZeroCopyDetach`** (`JS_DetachArrayBuffer` on an external buffer).
  **Not yet verified locally** — see Q1a.
- **JSC → `CopyInCopyOut`**, detaching the engine-owned buffer via E2's
  `transfer()` (the reliable path), invoked through `JSObjectCallAsFunction`.

**This is spec-conformant, not a deviation.** WebGPU defines the contents of a
mapped range as becoming visible to the GPU at `unmap()`, so copying at `unmap()`
is exactly the contract. The cost is one `memcpy` per mapped range per map cycle
on the JSC tier — a **performance** difference, recorded here, not a behavioural
one. JSC is Tier 2 / experimental (`CLAUDE.md` → Engine support tiers), so this
is an acceptable price.

### Why this validates the boundary rather than breaking it

The fix is a **capability enum plus an additive trait method**
(`detach_arraybuffer` returning `Result<(), Unsupported>`, and a
`MAPPED_RANGE_STRATEGY` associated const). `core/` implements *both* strategies
once, generic over `E`, and selects on the capability. No engine-specific branch
enters `core/`, and no conversion logic is duplicated.

Per `specs/reference/workflow.md` → "The JSC phase carries an extra exit gate",
adding a trait method or capability variant is **additive** and does not trip the
gate. `CLAUDE.md` invariant 1 stands.

Had we discovered this in Phase 3 instead of Phase 0, the copy path would have
been retrofitted into ~40 generated interfaces. This is what Phase 0 is for.

## Q1a — Does QuickJS `JS_DetachArrayBuffer` work on an external buffer?

**Status: OPEN.** Assumed yes (it is the documented purpose of the API), but
unverified: there is no QuickJS checkout in this environment yet, and the answer
gates the `ZeroCopyDetach` arm above.

Folded into the handoff below rather than spiked separately — the two arms of
`MappedRangeStrategy` should be proven by the same harness.

### Handoff → coding agent

```
## Task: engine-boundary — prove both MappedRangeStrategy arms

Phase: 0
Goal: A headless Rust harness that demonstrates, for each engine, that a mapped
      range handed to script is unreachable after unmap().

Inputs to read:
- specs/tracking/engine-boundary.md  (this file: E1..E4, the Decision)
- specs/reference/workflow.md, CLAUDE.md

Produce:
- A throwaway spike crate (NOT core/): for each engine, allocate a page,
  expose it to script as an ArrayBuffer per that engine's strategy, run a
  script that stashes a reference to it, "unmap", then prove from script that
  the stashed reference is detached (byteLength === 0 / throws on access).
- QuickJS arm: JS_NewArrayBuffer(..., free_func) + JS_DetachArrayBuffer.
  Confirm detach succeeds on an *external* buffer and that the free_func
  fires exactly once, at the expected time.
- JSC arm: engine-owned ArrayBuffer + copy-in/copy-out + detach via
  ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer() through JSObjectCallAsFunction.
  Confirm detach and that no pointer to foreign memory ever reaches script.
- Record the minimum macOS/iOS version at which transfer() is available.

Out of scope: real GPU, webgpu.h calls, core/ changes, commits.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] both arms: post-unmap access from script fails, observably
- [ ] QuickJS: free_func fires exactly once; no leak, no double free
- [ ] run under ASan; no use-after-free
- [ ] headless: no GPU, no window
- [ ] no local or sibling filesystem paths in any committed file
- [ ] clippy clean with -D warnings

Report back: the two arms' results, the transfer() minimum OS version, and
whether QuickJS detach on an external buffer behaves as assumed. If it does
not, STOP and report — the Decision above depends on it.
```

## Q2 — Which QuickJS fork, and `rquickjs` vs raw `bindgen`?

**Status: OPEN.** Plan §3.2 / §6.3. Bellard's original vs. quickjs-ng. Not yet
investigated; blocks nothing until the Q1a harness needs a QuickJS dependency,
at which point it forces the choice. Decide with a written rationale then.
