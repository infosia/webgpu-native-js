# Tracking: engine boundary (`trait JsEngine`)

Topic owner: the core/adapter boundary — `CLAUDE.md` invariant 1, plan §2.4.

---

## Q1 — Does JSC's public C API expose ArrayBuffer detach?

**Status: ANSWERED (2026-07-09). No. Design absorbed it as a capability; the
boundary survives.**

This was the highest-priority Phase 0 spike (plan §4, Phase 0.1) because
`getMappedRange()` must return an `ArrayBuffer` that `unmap()` **detaches**, and
a failure here was the most likely way the "one core, two engines" bet breaks.

### Environment

macOS 26.5.1 (build 25F80), Xcode SDK 26.5, system
`JavaScriptCore.framework` (bundle version 21624). Probes were Objective-C
programs linking the system framework and driving the public C API.

### Evidence

**E1 — the public C API has no detach.** The exported surface of
`JSTypedArray.h` is exactly:

```
JSObjectMakeTypedArray                    JSObjectGetTypedArrayBytesPtr
JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithBytesNoCopy     JSObjectGetTypedArrayLength
JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithArrayBuffer     JSObjectGetTypedArrayByteLength
JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithArrayBufferAndOffset
                                          JSObjectGetTypedArrayByteOffset
JSObjectMakeArrayBufferWithBytesNoCopy    JSObjectGetTypedArrayBuffer
                                          JSObjectGetArrayBufferBytesPtr
                                          JSObjectGetArrayBufferByteLength
```

A case-insensitive search for `detach` or `transfer` across **all** public
JavaScriptCore headers (`JSBase.h`, `JSObjectRef.h`, `JSValueRef.h`,
`JSTypedArray.h`, `JSStringRef.h`, `JSContextRef.h`, and the Obj-C headers)
returns **no match**. There is no C-level detach, and no C-level way to observe
detachment.

**E2 — the JS-level `ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer()` exists and works on
*normal* buffers.** `typeof ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer === "function"`, and
for a script-allocated `new ArrayBuffer(8)`, `b.transfer()` yields
`b.detached === true`. The `detached` getter is present (`'detached' in ab`).
This is reachable from the C API via `JSObjectGetProperty` +
`JSObjectCallAsFunction`.

**E3 — on an *external* (`…WithBytesNoCopy`) buffer, `transfer()` is not
dependable.** Across probes:

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| `ab.transfer()` on a fresh external buffer | once returned a new 8-byte buffer with **`ab.detached === false`** and the original still readable; once threw `TypeError: Buffer is already detached` on a *freshly created* buffer |
| `ab.transfer(8)` (explicit length) on a fresh external buffer | `detached === true` |
| `ab.transferToFixedLength()` | `TypeError` |
| `structuredClone` / `Worker` (transfer-list routes) | `ReferenceError` — absent from a bare `JSContext` |

**E4 — the `bytesDeallocator` never fired** in any probe, including after a
successful `transfer(8)`. So even where detach appears to succeed, there is no
public signal that JSC has released the external memory.

### Interpretation

E1 alone rules out the obvious design. E3's inconsistency — a no-arg
`transfer()` that silently leaves the source attached in one trial and reports
an already-detached buffer in another — means the semantics of `transfer()` over
externally-backed storage are, at minimum, unspecified for our purposes. E4
means we could not safely reclaim the memory even if detach were reliable.

The consequence is not a spec deviation, it is **memory unsafety**: if
`getMappedRange()` hands script a `…WithBytesNoCopy` view over GPU-mapped memory
and `unmap()` cannot detach it, a script that retains the `ArrayBuffer` holds a
dangling pointer. That is a CRITICAL-class defect, not a conformance footnote.

### Decision

**`getMappedRange()` never hands JSC a NoCopy view over GPU memory.**

`trait JsEngine` gains a capability, declared by each adapter:

```rust
enum MappedRangeStrategy {
    /// Wrap the GPU mapping directly; `unmap()` detaches the external buffer.
    ZeroCopyDetach,
    /// Hand script a normal engine-owned ArrayBuffer.
    /// MAP_READ:  copy GPU -> JS at getMappedRange().
    /// MAP_WRITE: copy JS -> GPU at unmap(), then detach.
    CopyInCopyOut,
}
```

- **QuickJS → `ZeroCopyDetach`** (`JS_DetachArrayBuffer` on an external buffer).
  **Not yet verified locally** — see Q1a.
- **JSC → `CopyInCopyOut`**, detaching the engine-owned buffer via E2's
  `transfer()` (the reliable path), invoked through `JSObjectCallAsFunction`.

**This is spec-conformant, not a deviation.** WebGPU defines the contents of a
mapped range as becoming visible to the GPU at `unmap()`, so copying at `unmap()`
is exactly the contract. The cost is one `memcpy` per mapped range per map cycle
on the JSC tier — a **performance** difference, recorded here, not a behavioural
one. JSC is Tier 2 / experimental (`CLAUDE.md` → Engine support tiers), so this
is an acceptable price.

### Why this validates the boundary rather than breaking it

The fix is a **capability enum plus an additive trait method**
(`detach_arraybuffer` returning `Result<(), Unsupported>`, and a
`MAPPED_RANGE_STRATEGY` associated const). `core/` implements *both* strategies
once, generic over `E`, and selects on the capability. No engine-specific branch
enters `core/`, and no conversion logic is duplicated.

Per `specs/reference/workflow.md` → "The JSC phase carries an extra exit gate",
adding a trait method or capability variant is **additive** and does not trip the
gate. `CLAUDE.md` invariant 1 stands.

Had we discovered this in Phase 3 instead of Phase 0, the copy path would have
been retrofitted into ~40 generated interfaces. This is what Phase 0 is for.

## Q1a — Does QuickJS `JS_DetachArrayBuffer` work on an external buffer?

**Status: OPEN.** Assumed yes (it is the documented purpose of the API), but
unverified: there is no QuickJS checkout in this environment yet, and the answer
gates the `ZeroCopyDetach` arm above.

Folded into the handoff below rather than spiked separately — the two arms of
`MappedRangeStrategy` should be proven by the same harness.

### Handoff → coding agent

```
## Task: engine-boundary — prove both MappedRangeStrategy arms

Phase: 0
Goal: A headless Rust harness that demonstrates, for each engine, that a mapped
      range handed to script is unreachable after unmap().

Inputs to read:
- specs/tracking/engine-boundary.md  (this file: E1..E4, the Decision)
- specs/reference/workflow.md, CLAUDE.md

Dependencies (per Q2, already decided — do not re-litigate):
- quickjs-ng, pinned git submodule at third_party/quickjs, built from our own
  build.rs. Bindings via bindgen. Do NOT add rquickjs or rquickjs-sys.
- JSC: link the system JavaScriptCore.framework (macOS). No submodule.

Produce:
- A throwaway spike crate (NOT core/): for each engine, allocate a page,
  expose it to script as an ArrayBuffer per that engine's strategy, run a
  script that stashes a reference to it, "unmap", then prove from script that
  the stashed reference is detached (byteLength === 0 / throws on access).
- QuickJS arm: JS_NewArrayBuffer(ctx, buf, len, free_func, opaque, is_shared)
  over *external* memory + JS_DetachArrayBuffer. Confirm detach succeeds and
  that free_func fires exactly once, at the expected time. quickjs-ng ships
  Resizable ArrayBuffer, so this is a real test, not a formality.
- JSC arm: engine-owned ArrayBuffer + copy-in/copy-out + detach via
  ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer() through JSObjectCallAsFunction.
  Confirm detach and that no pointer to foreign memory ever reaches script.
- Record the minimum macOS/iOS version at which transfer() is available.

Out of scope: real GPU, webgpu.h calls, core/ changes, commits.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] both arms: post-unmap access from script fails, observably
- [ ] QuickJS: free_func fires exactly once; no leak, no double free
- [ ] run under ASan; no use-after-free
- [ ] headless: no GPU, no window
- [ ] no local or sibling filesystem paths in any committed file
- [ ] clippy clean with -D warnings

Report back: the two arms' results, the transfer() minimum OS version, and
whether QuickJS detach on an external buffer behaves as assumed. If it does
not, STOP and report — the Decision above depends on it.

## Q2 — Which QuickJS fork, and `rquickjs` vs raw `bindgen`?

**Status: DECIDED (2026-07-09).**
**Fork: [quickjs-ng](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs), pinned as a git
submodule. Bindings: raw `bindgen` from our own `build.rs`. We depend on neither
`rquickjs` nor `rquickjs-sys`.**

### Q2a — the fork

**Decision: quickjs-ng.** The decisive criterion is **MSVC support**, and it is
not a close call.

Windows is a *development target*, and `CLAUDE.md` → "Target platforms" makes
behavioral parity across all four platforms a first-class concern precisely
because dev/test results must predict production behavior. An engine that does
not build under the platform's native toolchain undermines that.

| | Bellard's `quickjs` | `quickjs-ng` |
|---|---|---|
| MSVC | **No official support**; long-standing open issues requesting it | **"Windows as a first class citizen"**, MSVC supported |
| Build system | Makefile, Unix-oriented | CMake, explicitly for cross-platform |
| Android / iOS | not called out | called out as supported platforms |
| CI | — | every PR tested in **50+ configurations** across OSes, build types, and **sanitizers**; test262 on every change |
| Cadence | occasional | ~a release every 2 months; latest v0.15.1 (2026-06-04), 20 releases |
| Community | Bellard + Gordon | 40+ contributors, 400+ PRs reviewed in the open |
| License | MIT | **MIT** (Bellard, Gordon, Noordhuis, Ibarra Corretgé) |

The sanitizer CI matters concretely: the Q1a harness below must run under ASan,
and an engine already tested under sanitizers upstream is far likelier to give a
clean signal about *our* bug rather than *its* bug.

**Do not rest this decision on "the original went dormant."** That is
quickjs-ng's own framing of its motivation, and the original has continued to
ship occasional releases. The decision rests on MSVC, CMake, and CI breadth,
which are directly verifiable.

**Divergence accepted.** quickjs-ng drops Bellard's `libbf`-based BigDecimal /
BigFloat and adds Resizable ArrayBuffer, `Float16Array`, iterator helpers, and
V8-compatible stack-trace APIs. None of the removals touch WebGPU binding work,
and bytecode incompatibility with Bellard's is irrelevant to us. **Resizable
ArrayBuffer is worth a note** — it changes ArrayBuffer internals, so Q1a's
detach-on-external-buffer test is a genuine test, not a formality.

The APIs the design depends on are present: `JS_NewArrayBuffer(ctx, buf, len,
free_func, opaque, is_shared)` accepts **external memory with a custom
`JSFreeArrayBufferDataFunc`**, and `JS_DetachArrayBuffer(ctx, obj)` exists. This
is the API-level basis for the `ZeroCopyDetach` arm; Q1a proves it at runtime.

### Q2b — `rquickjs` vs raw `bindgen`

**Decision: raw `bindgen`. Depend on neither crate.** Three reasons, in order of
weight.

**1. `rquickjs` is the wrong layer.** It is a *high-level safe binding* with its
own context/lifetime model and its own class-registration system. Our entire
thesis (`CLAUDE.md` invariant 1) is that `trait JsEngine` is the one abstraction
over engines. Putting rquickjs beneath it stacks two abstractions doing the same
job, and the lower one would dictate the shape of the upper. The adapter needs
raw, precise control over class opaque pointers, finalizer timing,
`JS_DetachArrayBuffer`, and `JS_ExecutePendingJob` — exactly the primitives a
safe wrapper exists to hide.

**2. `rquickjs-sys` ships no bindings for our production platforms.** Its
pre-generated bindings cover Linux, Windows (gnu + msvc), macOS, and wasm32-wasi.
**Neither Android nor iOS.** For our two ship targets we would enable its
`bindgen` feature anyway — i.e. run bindgen ourselves, through someone else's
`build.rs`, against a quickjs-ng revision they pin rather than we do.

**3. Symmetry with what we already do.** Phase 0.2/0.6 pins `webgpu-headers` and
runs `bindgen` over `webgpu.h` in our own `build.rs`. Doing the same for
`quickjs.h` from a pinned quickjs-ng submodule is the *same machinery*, one fewer
third-party `build.rs` between us and the engine we are abstracting, and it
honours `CLAUDE.md` principle 9 (generated code is a build artifact, never
committed, fix the generator not the output).

**Cost, stated honestly:** we own the NDK / iOS / MSVC build wiring for the C
sources. We own it under either choice, because of reason 2.

**`rquickjs-sys` remains useful as a reference** (MIT): its `build.rs` shows a
working `cc`-based vendored quickjs-ng compile. Read it; do not depend on it.

**Named fallback.** If our own `build.rs` for the four platforms exceeds roughly
a week of effort, adopt `rquickjs-sys` with the `bindgen` feature and revisit.
Record the switch here. This is a build-plumbing decision, not an architectural
one — it must not be allowed to become one.

---

## Q3 — Which QuickJS revision is pinned?

**Status: OPEN.** Pin a specific quickjs-ng tag (v0.15.1 is current as of
2026-07-09) when the submodule is added, and record the tag here alongside the
`webgpu-headers` pin (Phase 0.6). Two independently-versioned upstreams; both
pins live in tracking docs, not in prose.
